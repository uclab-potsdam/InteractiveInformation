<h1>Albus Dumbledore | The Grand Sorcerer</h1>
<h2></h2>

<h3>He will be under the finest Headmaster that  Hogwarts has ever seen.</h3>
<h3>Every day..</h3>
<h3>Albus Dumbledore.</h3>
<h3>..every hour, this very minute perhaps..</h3>
<h3>I've got Dumbledore!</h3>
<h3>..dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle's walls.</h3>
<h3>Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared?</h3>
<h3>You are the only wizard who is his equal.</h3>
<h3>Dumbledore!</h3>
<h3>I need you to fight him.</h3>
<h3>Soon we must all face the choice between what is right and what is easy.</h3>
<h3>I can't.</h3>
<h3>Well, then you have chosen your side.</h3>
<h3>But you know happiness can be  found even in the darkest of times..</h3>
<h3>..when only one remembers to turn on the light.</h3>
<h3>Did you love her?</h3>
<h3>Not as well as I should have done.</h3>
<h3>Regret is my constant companion. Do not let it become yours.</h3>
<h3>I know how you feel, Harry.</h3>
<h3>No, you don't.</h3>
<h3>Severus...please.</h3>
<h3>You and Grindelwald were as close as brothers.</h3>
<h3>Oh, we were closer than brothers.</h3>
<h3>There is a legend in your family that phoenix will come to any member..</h3>
<h3>..who is in dire need.</h3>
<h3>It is your birthright.</h3>
<h3>It was foolish of you to come here tonight, Tom.</h3>
<h3>But you can't deny. Dumbledore has got a style.</h3>
<h3>Dumbledore is the great wizard, only a fool would question it.</h3>
<h3>What makes Albus Dumbledore..</h3>
<h3>..so fond of you?</h3>
<h3>Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!</h3>
<h3>He'll never be gone. Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him!</h3>
<h3>Severus. Severus is all I need.</h3>
<h3>I'm fine.</h3>
<h3>Never insult Albus Dumbledore infront of me.</h3>
<h3>Do you know why I admire you, Newt?</h3>
<h3>You do not seek power.</h3>
<h3>You simly ask: Is the thing right?</h3>
<h3>You meant a great deal to him.</h3>
