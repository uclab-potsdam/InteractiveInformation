00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
My favorite part about mountain biking is being in the woods

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
yet conversations about it always steer toward the exhilarating parts.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.000
Going fast and hitting jumps is cool

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:18.000
but sadly these days I spend more time sitting at a desk 
than I do trying to get rad on a bicycle.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Unplugging from the screens and the noise of the world seems more important than ever.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Hopping on my bike and putting a little effort into the pedals carries me away.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
In a little while my legs loosen up

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.000
my body starts to remember it can do more than sit at a desk chair.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Eventually the computer screen burned into my eyes clears

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.000
and when I finally hit the woods and the noise of the cars fades away

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.000
everything calms down

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
things get simple again.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I start with a good climb and I quickly stop thinking at all.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
There's nothing but breathing and turning the pedals.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I know it's not exactly solving the world's problems

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
but it helps my brain find room to put them into perspective.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.500
20 minutes later on a plateau deeper in the woods

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.000
my only thoughts are simple.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
This is such a nice place to be. The trees are beautiful.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
It's peaceful here.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Eventually I make it to the top of some fun trail.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
It feels like a roller coaster starting up as the momentum builds

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and every time without fail I'm reminded

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
that one of the base joys at the heart of bike riding

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
is rolling down a hill.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.000
I don't have to push it or test myself

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
though of course sometimes I do.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It just feels good to be riding through the trees.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.500
It's so grounding to be out here in the woods

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.000
and I love that my bike takes me here.
