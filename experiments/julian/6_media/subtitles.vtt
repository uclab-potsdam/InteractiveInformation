My favorite part about mountain biking is being in the woods

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
yet conversations about it always steer toward the exhilarating parts.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Going fast and hitting jumps is cool

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
but sadly these days I spend more time sitting at a desk than I do trying to get rad on a bicycle.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Unplugging from the screens and the noise of the world seems more important than ever.

Hopping on my bike and putting a little effort into the pedals
carries me away.
In a little while my legs loosen up
my body starts to remember it can do more
than sit at a desk chair.
Eventually the computer screen
burned into my eyes clears
and when I finally hit the woods
and the noise of the cars fades away
everything calms down
things get simple again.
I start with a good climb
and I quickly stop thinking at all.
There's nothing but breathing and turning the pedals.
I know it's not exactly solving the world's problems
but it helps my brain find room to put them into perspective.
20 minutes later on a plateau deeper in the woods
my only thoughts are simple.
This is such a nice place to be
the trees are beautiful.
It's peaceful here.
Eventually I make it to the top of some fun trail.
It feels like a roller coaster starting up
as the momentum builds
and every time without fail I'm reminded
that one of the base joys
at the heart of bike riding
is rolling down a hill.
I don't have to push it or test myself
though of course sometimes I do.
It just feels good to be riding through the trees
it's so grounding to be out here in the woods
and I love that my bike takes me here.
