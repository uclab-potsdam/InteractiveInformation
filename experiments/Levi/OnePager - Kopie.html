        <h2>What are Memes?</h2>
            <p>
            Memes are the internet’s inside jokes, a shared 
            cultural currency of humor, relatability, and 
            randomness. The term itself comes from Richard 
            Dawkins’ The Selfish Gene (1976), where it meant 
            a cultural idea that spreads like wildfire. 
            Fast-forward to today, memes are those images, 
            videos, or phrases you see everywhere, from your 
            group chat to your grandma’s Facebook (looking at 
            you, Minion memes). They’re fun, quick, and 
            endlessly remixable.

        <h2>What makes a Meme?</h2>
            <p>
            A meme isn’t just a picture—it’s a mood, a vibe, 
            a virtual wink. A good meme combines visuals 
            (usually an iconic image or GIF), text (punchy 
            captions that hit just right), and context (we 
            all need to get it). The secret sauce? 
            Relatability. Memes thrive on shared experiences
            and cultural moments, making us laugh because, 
            let’s face it, we’ve all been there. Unlike a 
            regular ol’ picture, a meme’s magic is its viral
            potential—it evolves, mutates, and spreads like
            internet wildfire, often getting better (or 
            weirder) along the way.
